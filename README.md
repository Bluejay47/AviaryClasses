# Aviary Classes - Custom Archetypes for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous

A mod adding **five unique archetypes** and a **magical companion item** to expand your character build options with innovative mechanics and playstyles.

- This mod is still in beta, please do be careful using it as it may cause issues with your save file.
- The mod is balanced for Core and below to add some interesting twists to playthroughs. I have not tested it on higher difficulties.

## ü¶Ö **NEW ARCHETYPES**

### üåø **Life Sensate** (Kineticist Archetype)
*"In stark contrast to their more explosive brethren, Life Sensates have learned to harness the raw power of the elements not to scorch their foes, but to mend the wounds of their allies. These unique kineticists hone their ability to channel forces through rigorous life long studies into primal life energies learning to revive, heal, and protect those around them."*

**Key Changes:**
- **Intelligence-based** instead of Constitution-based (uses rigorous studies rather than raw physicality)
- **Water element ONLY** - cannot access Fire/Earth/Air (major damage limitation for balance)
- **No burn or elemental overflow** mechanics (replaced with "Lingering Energies" buffer system - displayed as a buff icon)
- **Alignment restriction:** True Neutral or Good only
- **Improved saves:** Enhanced Will saves, reduced Fort/Reflex saves

**Level Progression:**
- **Levels 1-3:** Life Attunement, Kinetic Healer, Healing Burst, Lingering Energies buffer (shown as numbered buff icon)
- **Level 6:** **Empowered Healing** - Kinetic Healer gains automatic Empower metamagic
- **Level 10:** **Kinetic Revivification** - Raise dead through kinetic energy
- **Level 13:** **Kinetic Instauration** - Enhanced restoration removing multiple conditions
- **Level 17:** **Mass Kinetic Instauration** - Area-effect restoration for entire party

**Playstyle:** Pure support healer with Intelligence-based mechanics and a visual buffer system (Lingering Energies buff shows remaining charges). **Important:** Limited to Water element only, which significantly reduces damage potential compared to standard Kineticists (no access to powerful Fire/Earth damage abilities). This trade-off balances the powerful healing capabilities and eliminates the burn management of typical Kineticists.

### üèπ **Arcane Skirmisher** (Magus Archetype)
*"Masters of both mounted combat and arcane marksmanship, these versatile warriors ride into battle atop mounts imbued with magical speed and agility. With a swift gesture, they can enchant their arrows with elemental forces or debilitating effects, turning each shot into a potentially game-changing strike from the saddle."*

**Key Changes:**
- **Ranged Spell Combat** with shortbows instead of melee
- **Arcane Mount** instead of spell recall abilities
- **Dimensional Ride** for tactical mobility
- **Specialized archery feats** progression

**Level Progression:**
- **Level 1:** Arcane Mount, Ranged Spell Combat (Shortbow), Weapon Focusclaude
- **Level 2:** **Ranged Spell Strike** - Apply touch spells through arrows
- **Level 8:** **Dimensional Ride** - Teleport with your mount
- **Level 14:** **Greater Dimensional Ride** - Enhanced mobility options
- **Levels 5-17:** Complete archery feat progression (Greater Focus, Specialization, etc.)

**Playstyle:** Mobile mounted archer combining spellcasting with precise ranged attacks, ideal for hit-and-run tactics and battlefield control.

**üîß Bug Fix:** This mod fixes an old vanilla bug where Arcane Weapon Enchantment (with Enduring Blade active) would fail to work while mounted. The enchantments now correctly apply to your weapon regardless of mount status!

### üîÆ **Keen-Eyed Adventurer (AC Version)** (Witch Archetype)
*"Focus, perception, and a keen-eye are the hallmarks of good adventurers. It's amazing what one can do when these attributes are applied to something as simple as cantrips."*

An alternative take on the existing Keen-Eyed Adventurer 

**Key Changes:**
- **Cantrip specialization** with Intelligence scaling damage
- **Animal companion** with full progression
- **Enhanced cantrip mechanics** with AoE effects
- **Overpowered Vortex** replacing standard hex progression

**Level Progression:**
- **Level 1:** **Cantrip Specialization** - Add Intelligence modifier damage to Ignition, Ray of Frost, Jolt, Acid Splash
- **Level 4:** **Animal Companion** (Divine Hound progression, levels 5-20)
- **Level 9:** **Overpowered Cantrips** - Toggle ability adding +1 damage per die + splash damage to 1-3 additional targets
- **Level 13:** **Ascendant Cantrips** - Your 4 basic cantrips (Ignition, Ray of Frost, Jolt, Acid Splash) ignore elemental resistance and immunity
- **Level 16:** **Overpowered Vortex** - When Elemental Vortex is active, randomly strikes 2-6 enemies with 10d3 + Int modifier elemental damage each round

**Playstyle:** Cantrip-focused damage dealer who turns basic spells into powerful AoE attacks, perfect for players who enjoy consistent magical damage output.

### üèúÔ∏è **Dustwalker** (Monk Archetype)

Drawing from ancient traditions of balance and survival, Dustwalkers forsake some traditional monastic abilities in favor of practical skills for leading groups through dangerous terrain."*

- **Enhanced weapon/armor proficiency** - All simple and martial weapons, light armor
- **Animal companion** progression with ki-enhanced mount abilities

- **Level 11:** Master Guardian Techniques (additional flurry attack)
- **Level 13:** Desert Camouflage (stealth in favored terrains as move action)

**Playstyle:** Versatile mounted warrior combining survival expertise, terrain mastery, and enhanced combat abilities. Perfect for neutral-aligned characters who want practical skills, animal companionship, and flexibility in weapon choices while maintaining core monk combat effectiveness.

### üéµ **Beast Tamer (AC Version)** (Bard Archetype) - STILL IN ALPHA

## ü¶ï **MAGICAL ITEM**

### **Triceratops Statuette (Enhanced)**
*"This seemingly simple statue swirls with the primal energy of Triceratop heroes of ages past. Using it may bind the spirit of those heroes to your cause. Echoes from the energies whisper the name 'Bismuth'."*

**Item Details:**

- **Availability:** Purchasable from equipment vendors in Defender's Heart
- **Restriction:** Cannot be used if you already have an animal companion

**What it does:**
- Grants a **permanent Triceratops animal companion**
- Provides **full 1:1 level progression** with your character

**Perfect for:** Any character build that wants a powerful companion without investing in animal companion classes.

Note: This replaces the existing Bismuth statue, and right now is available both in a Defender's Heart merchant and the "normal" location. The Defender's Heart version will go away when the mod is finalized.

## üîß **OTHER FIXES / CHANGES**

### **Enduring Blade Mount Fix**
Fixes vanilla bug where Arcane Weapon Enchantment doesn't work when Enduring Blade is active and the Magus is mounted. The fix prevents the mount's weapon enchantment logic from clearing the rider's weapon pool.

### **Magic Deceiver + Red Salamandra Ring Compatibility** ‚ú®
**The Change**: Allows Magic Deceiver archetype to use item-granted temporary spells while maintaining Magic Fusion balance.

**The Problem**:
- Magic Deceiver's spellbook blocks ALL temporary spells from items (intentional to prevent broken Magic Fusion combinations)
- Wanted certain "safe" items (Red Salamandra Ring fire spells) to work
- Magic Fusion UI uses async reactive properties that couldn't be forced to refresh synchronously

**The Solution - Two-Layer Defense System**:

1. **Layer 1: Item Whitelist** (`MagicDeceiverRedSalamandraFix.cs`)
   - Patches `UnitPartTemporarySpellsKnown.RefreshKnownSpells()`
   - Manually grants spells from whitelisted items (currently: Red Salamandra Ring)
   - Easily extensible: Add more safe items via GUID checks
   - Spells are fully functional and castable

2. **Layer 2: Magic Fusion Filter** (`MagicHackTemporarySpellFilter.cs`)
   - Prevents temporary spells from appearing in Magic Fusion UI (defense against untested combinations)
   - **UI refresh technique**: Toggles `m_CurrentLevel` reactive property to trigger immediate synchronous UI update
   - Bypasses Unity's async `ObserveLastValueOnLateUpdate` pattern that blocked all previous refresh attempts
   - Auto-resets when spellbook closes for consistent state management

**Result**: Red Salamandra Ring spells in Magic Deceiver spell books now:
- ‚úÖ Grant immediately when equipped
- ‚úÖ Are castable in combat
- ‚úÖ Appear in normal spellbook view
- ‚úÖ Disappear instantly when Magic Fusion UI opens (defense-in-depth)
- ‚úÖ Reappear instantly when Magic Fusion UI closes

**Impact**: Opens the door for carefully balanced item compatibility with Magic Deceiver while maintaining the archetype's unique Magic Fusion mechanics.

**Whitelist System**:

Currently whitelisted items:
- ‚úÖ **Red Salamandra Ring** - Fire spells (Fireball, Controlled Fireball, Firesnake, Hellfire Ray, Fire Storm, Fiery Body)

**Why whitelist instead of allowing all items?**
Magic Fusion is untested with most temporary spell sources. Each item needs individual balance review to ensure combinations don't trivialize content. The whitelist approach:
- Provides careful balance control
- Allows progressive expansion
- Makes it clear which items are "intended"
- Protects against unknown power creep

**Community Requests Welcome!**
Modders can easily modify the whitelist themselves - see comments in `MagicDeceiverRedSalamandraFix.cs` for instructions.
