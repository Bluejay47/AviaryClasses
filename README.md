# Aviary Classes - Custom Archetypes for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous

A mod adding **four unique archetypes** and a **magical companion item** to expand your character build options with innovative mechanics and playstyles.

- This mod is still in beta, please do be careful using it as it may cause issues with your save file.
- The mod is balanced for Core and below to add some interesting twists to playthroughs. I have not tested it on higher difficulties.

## ü¶Ö **NEW ARCHETYPES**

### üåø **Life Sensate** (Kineticist Archetype)
*"In stark contrast to their more explosive brethren, Life Sensates have learned to harness the raw power of the elements not to scorch their foes, but to mend the wounds of their allies. These unique kineticists hone their ability to channel forces through rigorous life long studies into primal life energies learning to revive, heal, and protect those around them."*

**Key Changes:**
- **Intelligence-based** instead of Constitution-based (uses rigorous studies rather than raw physicality)
- **Water element ONLY** - cannot access Fire/Earth/Air (major damage limitation for balance)
- **No burn or elemental overflow** mechanics (replaced with "Lingering Energies" buffer system - displayed as a buff icon)
- **Alignment restriction:** True Neutral or Good only
- **Improved saves:** Enhanced Will saves, reduced Fort/Reflex saves

**Level Progression:**
- **Levels 1-3:** Life Attunement, Kinetic Healer, Healing Burst, Lingering Energies buffer (shown as numbered buff icon)
- **Level 6:** **Empowered Healing** - Kinetic Healer gains automatic Empower metamagic
- **Level 10:** **Kinetic Revivification** - Raise dead through kinetic energy
- **Level 13:** **Kinetic Instauration** - Enhanced restoration removing multiple conditions
- **Level 17:** **Mass Kinetic Instauration** - Area-effect restoration for entire party

**Playstyle:** Pure support healer with Intelligence-based mechanics and a visual buffer system (Lingering Energies buff shows remaining charges). **Important:** Limited to Water element only, which significantly reduces damage potential compared to standard Kineticists (no access to powerful Fire/Earth damage abilities). This trade-off balances the powerful healing capabilities and eliminates the burn management of typically Kineticists.

### üèπ **Arcane Skirmisher** (Magus Archetype)
*"Masters of both mounted combat and arcane marksmanship, these versatile warriors ride into battle atop mounts imbued with magical speed and agility. With a swift gesture, they can enchant their arrows with elemental forces or debilitating effects, turning each shot into a potentially game-changing strike from the saddle."*

**Key Changes:**
- **Ranged Spell Combat** with shortbows instead of melee
- **Arcane Mount** instead of spell recall abilities
- **Dimensional Ride** for tactical mobility
- **Specialized archery feats** progression

**Level Progression:**
- **Level 1:** Arcane Mount, Ranged Spell Combat (Shortbow), Weapon Focus
- **Level 2:** **Ranged Spell Strike** - Apply touch spells through arrows
- **Level 8:** **Dimensional Ride** - Teleport with your mount
- **Level 14:** **Greater Dimensional Ride** - Enhanced mobility options
- **Levels 5-17:** Complete archery feat progression (Greater Focus, Specialization, etc.)

**Playstyle:** Mobile mounted archer combining spellcasting with precise ranged attacks, ideal for hit-and-run tactics and battlefield control.

### üîÆ **Keen-Eyed Adventurer** (Witch Archetype)
*"Focus, perception, and a keen-eye are the hallmarks of good adventurers. It's amazing what one can do when these attributes are applied to something as simple as cantrips."*

An alternative take on the existing Keen-Eyed Adventurer 

**Key Changes:**
- **Cantrip specialization** with Intelligence scaling damage
- **Animal companion** with full progression
- **Enhanced cantrip mechanics** with AoE effects
- **Overpowered Vortex** replacing standard hex progression

**Level Progression:**
- **Level 1:** **Cantrip Specialization** - Add Intelligence modifier damage to Ignition, Ray of Frost, Jolt, Acid Splash
- **Level 4:** **Animal Companion** (Divine Hound progression, levels 5-20)
- **Level 9:** **Overpowered Cantrips** - Toggle ability adding +1 damage per die + splash damage to 1-3 additional targets
- **Level 13:** **Ascendant Cantrips** - Your 4 basic cantrips (Ignition, Ray of Frost, Jolt, Acid Splash) ignore elemental resistance and immunity
- **Level 16:** **Overpowered Vortex** - When Elemental Vortex is active, randomly strikes 2-6 enemies with 10d3 + Int modifier elemental damage each round

**Playstyle:** Cantrip-focused damage dealer who turns basic spells into powerful AoE attacks, perfect for players who enjoy consistent magical damage output.

### üèúÔ∏è **Dustwalker** (Monk Archetype)
*"These neutral-aligned monks have mastered the art of guiding caravans through treacherous desert routes and mountain passes. Drawing from ancient traditions of balance and survival, Dustwalkers forsake some traditional monastic abilities in favor of practical skills for leading groups through dangerous terrain."*

**Key Changes:**
- **Alignment restriction:** True Neutral or Neutral Good only (replaces Lawful requirement)
- **Enhanced weapon/armor proficiency** - All simple and martial weapons, light armor
- **Animal companion** progression with ki-enhanced mount abilities
- **Terrain mastery** with favored terrain bonuses and expertise
- **Practical combat focus** over mystical monk abilities

- **Level 1:** Guide's Mount (horse companion + ki enhancement), Caravan Weapon Training, Desert Lore
- **Level 2:** Caravan Guardian (+initiative bonus), Mounted Guide Combat (mounted combat feats)
- **Level 3:** Desert Specialist (+2 initiative/skills in desert), Desert Mastery (favored enemy bonus vs creatures in desert + fire resistance)
- **Level 4:** Spirit-Guided Weapons (ki weapon enhancement), Terrain Mastery (+3/+6 Lore Nature bonus)
- **Level 5:** Desert Hardening (poison immunity)
- **Level 6:** Planar Guide (+2 initiative/skills in Abyss terrain)
- **Level 8:** Planar Mastery (favored enemy bonus vs creatures in abyssal terrain)
- **Level 11:** Master Guardian Techniques (additional flurry attack)
- **Level 13:** Desert Camouflage (stealth in favored terrains as move action)

**Playstyle:** Versatile mounted warrior combining survival expertise, terrain mastery, and enhanced combat abilities. Perfect for neutral-aligned characters who want practical skills, animal companionship, and flexibility in weapon choices while maintaining core monk combat effectiveness.

## ü¶ï **MAGICAL ITEM**

### **Triceratops Statuette (Enhanced)**
*"This seemingly simple statue swirls with the primal energy of Triceratop heroes of ages past. Using it may bind the spirit of those heroes to your cause. Echoes from the energies whisper the name 'Bismuth'."*

**Item Details:**
- **Type:** Consumable magical item (1 charge, doesn't restore on rest)
- **Availability:** Purchasable from equipment vendors in Defender's Heart
- **Restriction:** Cannot be used if you already have an animal companion

**What it does:**

- Provides **full 1:1 level progression** with your character
- **Immediate proper level scaling** - companion spawns at correct level
- **Compatible with animal companion feats** (though Boon Companion is unnecessary)

**Perfect for:** Any character build that wants a powerful companion without investing in animal companion classes.
